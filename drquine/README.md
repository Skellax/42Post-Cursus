<h1 align = 'center'> DrQuine </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p align = 'justify'>A quine is a computer program (a kind of metaprogram) whose output and source
code are identical. As a challenge or for fun, some programmers try to write the shortest
quine in a given programming language.
The operation that consist of simply opening the source file and displaying it is
considered cheating. More generally, a program that uses any data entry cannot be
considered a valid quine. A trivial solution is a program whose source code is empty.
Indeed, the execution of such a program produces for most languages no output, that is
to say the source code of the program. </p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>you can validate this project without ASM if you want the 100% you need to 
finsihed the 3 exercices in C and ASM ! < /p> 

<ul>
  <li>File only .s for asm</li>
  <li>Need 3 programs with named Cooleen, Grace and Sully</li>
  <li>Your Makefile doesn't relink</li>
  <li>No Segfault, bus Error...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Colleen</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The executable must be named Colleen</li>
  <li>When executed, the program must display on the standard output an output
identical to the source code of the file used to compile the program. </li>
  <li>The source code must contain at least:
    <ul>
      <li>A main function </li>
      <li>Two different comments</li>
      <li>One of the comments must be present in the main function</li>
      <li>One of the comments must be present outside of your program.</li>
      <li>Another function in addition to the main function (which of course will be
called)</li>
</ul>

You can test you executable with this line command.
If there a no difference, it's good !

 ``` ./Colleen > tmp_Colleen ; diff tmp_Colleen Colleen.c ```

 <h3>Grace</h3>

 <ul>
   <li></li>
 </ul>
