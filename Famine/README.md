<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Famine is a binary you need to conceive that will modify one or multiple binaries ap-
plying some additional functions to it/them, without modifying the original behavior of
said binary(ies). So this time, we will limit ourselves to add a “signature” to this binary
and nothing else. Famine will have to apply this “signature” to all the binaries present
in a specific temporary folder. The “signature” is symbolized with a line containing your
specific logins and it could look like that:</p>

```Famine version 1.0 (c)oded by <first-login>-<second-login>```
