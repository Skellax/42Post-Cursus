<h2> Description</h2>

For the module 01 in Unity, you have to create a platformer game. 
In this Game you control 3 different character  and your goal is  to bring all character in the end of the level to pass for the 
next. Each level has is features for exemple a moving platformer or a teleporter but we'll see a little later ! 

<h2>Exercise 00: Thomas and his Friend</h2>

To start you need to create your first stage when you calling Stage1, for this stage you need to create a : 
<ul>
  <li>A Ground</li>
  <li>A Camera</li>
  <li>3 Characters Claire, John and Thomas</li>
</ul>

-You can switch character with Alpha1, Alpha2 and Alpha3 keys, 

-Yours characters move right and left and could jump with spacebar (no infinite jump or wall jump)

- The camera is automatically centered on the active character.

<h2>Exercise 01: Exit this way!</h2>

Each character are differents features: 

<ul>
  <li>Claire , the blue square moves slower and jumps lower thant ther others.</li>
  <li>John, the yellow stick moves faster and jumps higher thant the others.</li>
  <li>Thomas stands between both with an average speed and jump capacity.</li>
</ul>

Each characters stand in the exit for pass the next level. You  display a message to annouce it ! 

<h2> Exercise 02: Stage2!</h2>

For the second Stage you muste create platformer.

<ul>
  <li>Platforms are either white either a character's color</li>
  <li>Characters can only use white or their color's platforms. The go trough the others.</li>
  <li>You must link thes stages. When the cacracters finish a stage , they have to move to the next stage. If ther are no more
  stage, they have to go back in the first stage.</li>
</ul>

  Tips: for physics in the platforms you could use differents layers and use  Layer Collision Matrix (edit -> projet settings -> physics )

<h2> Exercise 03: Interactivity</h2>

In this part you need to add for your stage3 a moving platforms and teleporters.
