  <h2>Description</h2>

  The Goal of the first project to piscine Unity is to create a simple platform game where you control a simple ball. Your ball must move  vertically and horizontally and could jump. If the ball touch the lava  it's game over !

<h2>Exercice 00: Floor is Lava</h2>

In the first exercice you need to create your first scene. 
To create this game you need: 
<ul>
  <li>The floor</li>
  <li>A pathway</li>
  <li> A player</li>
  <li>Some decorations</li>
  <li>The camera</li>
</ul>

For the floor you can create with a square !  
For the pathway use you imagination you could create everything you want :) ! 
For the player a simple sphere is enough !
The camera is created automatically when you started Unity Project, you could move the camera to see the whole pathway (no need to create a moving camera , fixed camera like a good resident evil game is enough :) ! ) 

For this end of this exercice you could add color  for a better rendering.

<h2>Exercice 01: Path of Exile </h2>

For this exercice you have to add a script for controlling your player. To move you have to use WASD or the arrows and for the jump  your could use the SpaceBar. 

They have differents ways to moving your player , for me i use a Character Controller but you could use a Rigidbody :). 


<h2>Exercice 02: My Even more beautiful world</h2>

Very simple for this exercice you need to add texture for your scene. You could use Unity Asset Store or wathever you want to import your own textures. 


<h2>Exercice 03: The floor is always lava</h2>

For this end you add a GameOver when your ball touched the floor (you can just a Debug.Log will diplsay GameOver in the console).

You can find a lot of tutorial for helping you ! :)
